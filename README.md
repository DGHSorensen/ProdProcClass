# ProdProcClass
The .OWL file represents a classification scheme for production system processes.
It is a consolidated classification scheme capturing and categorising processes based on the utility they provide, whether this is form, time, place or information utility.
An open-access paper introducing and describing the classification scheme can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827118301203).

The classiifcation scheme itself was created in [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu).
More processes will gradually be added to the classification scheme, and the intention is to enrich the classification scheme with process attributes, ranges, and capabilities, effectively transforming it from a classification scheme into an ontology.
A classification coding scheme for classifying the characteristics of manufacturing systems was also created based on this classification scheme.
The classification coding scheme is documented in the paper entitled "Classification coding of production systems for identification of platform candidates", published in the CIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology, DOI [10.1016/j.cirpj.2019.11.001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cirpj.2019.11.001)
